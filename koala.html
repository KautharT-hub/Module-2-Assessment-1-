                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p> The koala, sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. Its closest living relatives are the wombats.</p>
                     <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                       <p>Koalas live in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Australia. When not sleeping, they're usually eating. They rely on the eucalyptus tree for both habitat and food. Koalas can eat more than a pound of eucalyptus leaves a day.</p>
